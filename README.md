# human-feedback-llama2
Fine-tunes Llama 3.2 3B using RLHF for production chatbots


# Dataset 
For dataset it choosen 
Dahoas/rm-static it is availabe on github


**Phase 1: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**
    * Fine-tune base Llama 3.2 on high-quality instruction-following data
    * Use the Dahoas/rm-static dataset's chosen responses

**Phase 2: Reward Model Training**
    * Train a reward model to predict human preferences
    * Use comparison pairs from the dataset (chosen vs rejected)

**Phase 3: Reinforcement Learning (PPO)**
    * Use PPO algorithm to optimize policy using the reward model
    * Fine-tune the SFT model with RL

What is the difference between attention and RNN?
Attention is a mechanism that can be used with an RNN or other type of model. It is a way to focus on certain parts of the input sequence, while ignoring other parts.
What is the difference between attention and GRU?
GRU is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can be used for sequence modeling. It is a type of RNN that uses a gated recurrent unit (GRU) to update its internal state. Attention is a mechanism that can be used with an RNN or other type of model. It is a way to focus on certain parts of the input sequence, while ignoring other parts.
What is the difference between attention and LSTM?

Attention mechanisms are neural networks that are designed to learn to focus on specific parts of input data, and to ignore other parts of the input.  The attention mechanism is used in deep learning models, such as neural networks, where each layer of the network is trained to learn to focus on different parts of the input data.  This allows the model to learn to focus on specific parts of the input data, and to ignore other parts of the input.  The attention mechanism is used to enable the neural network to focus on specific parts of the input data, and to ignore other parts of the input.  This allows the neural network to learn to focus on specific parts of the input data, and to ignore other parts of the input.
